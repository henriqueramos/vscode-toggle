# Toggle VS Code
Toggle any VS Code setting by your favorite keybindings.

## How To

Use vsce to [publish the package](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce) as a vsix file.

Add below sample keybinding entry to your personal keybinding file and make changes accordingly.

```
{
	"key": "F3",
	"command": "toggle",
	"when": "editorTextFocus",
	"args": {
		"id": "minimap",
		"value": [
			{
				"editor.minimap.enabled": true
			},
			{
				"editor.minimap.enabled": false
			}
		]
	}
},
{
	"key": "F4",
	"command": "toggle",
	"when": "editorTextFocus",
	"args": {
		"id": "zen",
		"value": [
			{
				"editor.minimap.enabled": true,
				"workbench.statusBar.visible": true
			},
			{
				"editor.minimap.enabled": false,
				"workbench.statusBar.visible": false
			}
		]
	}
}
```

**key**
The shortcut you want to use

**command**
Command should always be `toggle`. You can create multiple keybindings and use the same `command` name.

**args**
arguments for the settings you want to toggle.

**args.id**
This is the **unique** id/name for the set of settings you want to toggle.

**args.value**
This is an array for settings you want to toggle. Every item in this array is a simple JavaScript dictionary, the format is like

```
{
	"<SettingName>": <SettingValue>,
	"<SettingName>": <SettingValue>,
	...
}
```
